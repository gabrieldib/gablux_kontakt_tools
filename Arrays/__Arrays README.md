Arrays!

Sometimes we need to do some stuff with these animals and 
KSP is not there for our rescue. Well, here we go.

The scripts and what they do:

    gtk_arrays_pop_element:
        An example on how to pop out an element from an array

        This is a simple pop algorithm, that pops one given element
        at a time and moves all the subsequent elements down one position
        with the added feature to add a custom given value in the last position
