I created this example when I needed to have control over events in an architecture with multiple
layers, microphones and velocities (in case of the need for transitioning velocities with a midi CC)

turns out setting parameters to an event, multiple events or events selected by marks or combination of
marks, may not be as straight forward as one would imagine. Or at least not at first.

In general, the way to think about using marks is that you will probably want to select multiple events with it.

so, when creating the event, set its parameters using the event itself.

later, when using sliders for those parameters like vol, pan or tuning, then use the marks and their combinations.

If this explanation didn't help a bit, jsut look for my on Kontakt's Discord server (@Gablux)
