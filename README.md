# gablux_kontakt_tools

Welcome! After years writing code for Kontakt I finally decided to share some stuff that 
makes me excited or frustrated or proud or ashamed about. Ask me which one is which if you dare (on Discord Kontakt server).

I kindly ask you to credit me if you use any of the code. If you don't I will hunt you down
and all your family until the end of time. No I won't and I won't know. But you will. And your conscience. Shrug.

Also feel free to reach out on discord, email, in person (no).

Have fun!

PS: Right! KSP files are sublime text code (extended KSP) and txt files are compiled, vanilla, plain KSP code.


Change Log:
<ul>
    <li>
        Added sublime text plugin "AddFunctionId" to scan the current open and selected file
        for KSP functions and rename them with a prefix hashed id. This is specially useful
        when creating modules to be imported later into larger projects with lots of curstom
        user functions.
    </li>
    <li>
        ### v0.002 - 2025/07/06
        This is a stacked log, I added a bunch of things. Last ones being some array basic functions line pop an element
        and a sublime text plugin to format multi dimensional arrays from one line to multiple lines neatly with one shortcut.
    </li>
    <li>
        ### v0.001 - 2024/03/13
